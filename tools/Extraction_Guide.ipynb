    "\r\n",
    "By far most of the problems happen in the Adoption, Helper Tables and Unit Adoption classes; if you make it that far, you are usually about done.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " * The formulas in the top row and first column of the Helper Tables tab (for each of the REF and PDS tables) tend to have varying formulas. The extractor traditionally tried to keep up to date with which models would have which varients, but that code is inevitably brittle, so I've put less emphasis on that.  Instead, read the documentation on the Helper Tables `init` options, look at the Excel formulas, and set the arguments appropriately.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " * Sometime VMA data is missing.  This can particularly happen when proprietary data is removed from the Excel model.  This will usually show up as an error trying to load the VMA data, and may also show up as the Excel model computing nan where the python code computes a number. Fix the first part (loading the VMA) by changing the entries in the scenario files.  Change them from something like this:\r\n",

    "    ````\r\n",
    "  The second part of the problem is because Excel itself is relying on those missing values.  This is a case where it is legitimate to exclude\r\n",
    "  tests on a permanent basis. \r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "  * Sometimes Excel workbooks compute values on the Advanced Controls tab, and those computations override the Scenario values.  In Excel, when\r\n",
    "  you load a scenario, it copies all the scenario information from the ScenarioRecord tab into the places it belongs on the Advanced Controls\r\n",
    "  tab.  But some Excel workbooks have created additional computations to calculate those values, and the formula overrides the scenario value.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "## Don't forget to restart a Jupyter Notebook kernel if you have modified code\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If you change code you need to either reload the library (the 3nd cell of this notebook) or restart the kernel.   Rather than try to figure out if it safe to reload, I just restart the kernel every time.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## When comparing to Excel, make sure you've loaded the right Scenario\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On the `ScenarioRecord` tab, cell `B9` shows the currently loaded scenario.  When a workbook is first opened, this is usally empty, meaning you don't know which scenario was last loaded.  Select the scenario you are debugging against from the dropdown, and click on 'Load Scenario'.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Beautifier for Excel Formulas\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Are you looking at an excel formula with five nested `IF(...` expressions?  Try [https://www.excelformulabeautifier.com/](https://www.excelformulabeautifier.com/).  You're welcome.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Limit the number of scenarios\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We don't actually want a dozen scenarios for each solution.  Ideally, we would have the \"Book Edition 1\" scenarios (if the solution has them), and the most recent set of scenarios that don't look like someone was experimenting.  We always want scenarios in sets of (PDS1, PDS2 and PDS3), which might also sometimes be labeled (Plausible, DrawDown and Optimum).   To get rid of extra scenarios, just delete the scenario files from the `ac` directory (and document that you did so in changelog).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Removing excess scenarios makes your testing go faster.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Look through changelog files for other solutions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Look through changelog files to see if someone encountered a similar problem already, and how they solved it.\r\n",
    "Especially solutions belonging to the same sector (like electricity generation or transportation), which tend to be constructed in the same way.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Compare your Excel solution to other solutions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If you think the python code seems to be doing the wrong thing, it may be that your Excel workbook has a different implementation than other workbooks.\r\n",
    "The best way to check this is to use the Multi-Excel-Sample tool (in the tools directory) to look at the same bit of Excel from _all_ the workbooks.\r\n",
    "(If you don't have the permissions to look at all the workbooks, ask someone who does to produce the sample for you)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Contributing your Result\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Ideally you end up with a clean test run.  But even if you don't, we want to use the work you have done.  If you have made it as far as getting a Scenario object to load, please create a PR with your result.  Make sure to include any changes you made, and your observations of what worked and didn't, in a `changelog` file in your solution directory.\r\n",
